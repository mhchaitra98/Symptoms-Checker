# Disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This Machine Learning project is used to predict the disease based on the symptoms given by the user.It predicts using three different machine learning algorithms.So,the output is accurate.It uses tkinter for GUI.

Abstract - Disease Prediction system is based on predictive modeling predicts the disease of the user on the basis of the symptoms that user provides as an input to the system. The system analyzes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the probability of the disease asian output Disease Prediction is done by implementing the NaiveiBayes Classifier. Naive Bayes Classifier calculates the probability of the disease. With big data growth in biomedical and health care communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care. By using linear regression and decision tree we are predicting diseases like Diabetes, Malaria, Jaundice, Dengue, and Tuberculosis.
